# Learning Rust
This repo is where I will be following along with _The Rust Programming Language_ book, A.K.A. ["The Book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book).

# Important commands

### `cargo new <project name>`
Creates a new project set up with cargo

### `cargo build` 
Compiles you project and puts a binary in `target/debug/`

### `cargo run`
Will compile and then run the generated binary

### `cargo check`
Checks to see if the code compiles

### `cargo build --release`
Compiles the code with optimizations. It creates a binary in `target/release/`.

### `cargo doc --open`
Generates documentation for all of your dependencies locally.
